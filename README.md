# Image Picker Library : Simplified Image Handling for Android Developers

Are you an Android developer struggling with the intricacies of image selection, cropping, and rotation within your app? The `image-picker` library is here to simplify your image handling tasks and provide a seamless experience for your users. This versatile library offers the following features:

1. **Streamlined Image Selection:** Tired of complex code for capturing images from the camera or selecting from the gallery? The `image-picker` library allows you to effortlessly integrate image selection capabilities in your app. Bid farewell to tedious coding and concentrate on building a delightful user experience.
2. **Intuitive Cropping:** Cropping images often involves intricate calculations and user interactions. With the library's built-in cropping functionality, you can enable users to crop images intuitively. Whether it's refining a profile picture or selecting the perfect image dimensions, the library simplifies the process.

3. **Image Rotation Made Easy:** Correcting image orientation after capture can be a pain point. Our library seamlessly handles image rotation, ensuring your users always see their images correctly aligned. Say goodbye to rotated selfies and landscape images that don't display correctly!

## Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
Add the following code to your build.gradle file at the project level:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
## Step 2. Add the dependency
In your app-level build.gradle file, add the dependency for the image-picker library:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.colourmoon:image-picker:$VersonName'
}
```
Replace `$VersonName` with the actual version you want to use, for example:
```kotlin
implementation 'com.github.colourmoon:image-picker:v1.0.2'
```

## Step 3. Implement ResultImage in your Activity/Fragment and Call CMImagePicker

In your activity or fragment, follow these steps to integrate and use the CMImagePicker:

```kotlin
import androidx.activity.result.ActivityResult
import androidx.activity.result.ActivityResultLauncher
import androidx.activity.result.contract.ActivityResultContracts
import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.ImageView
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.colourmoon.imagepicker.CMImagePicker
import com.colourmoon.imagepicker.ResultImage
import java.io.File

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var imageView: ImageView

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        val imagePicker = CMImagePicker(this, launcher)
        imagePicker
            .allowCrop(false)
            .allowCompress(true)
            .allowGalleryOnly(false)
            .allowCameraOnly(false)
            .start()
    }

    private val launcher = object : ResultImage {
        override val result: ActivityResultLauncher<Intent> = registerForActivityResult(
            ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()
        ) { result: ActivityResult ->
            if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                val imagePath = result.data?.getStringExtra(RESULT_IMAGE_PATH)
                val imageFile: File? = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {
                    result.data?.getSerializableExtra(
                        RESULT_IMAGE_FILE, File::class.java
                    )
                } else {
                    result.data?.getSerializableExtra(RESULT_IMAGE_FILE) as File
                }

                // Handle the image path and image file here
                // Make sure to check for null and file existence before using them
                // doSomeOperations()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuration and descriotion Along with Comment
```kotlin
val imagePicker = CMImagePicker(this, launcher)
imagePicker
    .allowCrop(false) // Enable or disable cropping (default: false)
    .allowCompress(true) // Enable compression (default: false)
    .allowGalleryOnly(false) // Allow only gallery selection (default: both camera and gallery)
    .allowCameraOnly(false) // Allow only camera usage (default: both camera and gallery)
    .start() // Launch the image picker
````
## Result Image Callback:
```kotlin
private val launcher = object : ResultImage {
    override val result: ActivityResultLauncher<Intent> = registerForActivityResult(
        ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()
    ) { result: ActivityResult ->
        if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            // Retrieve image path and file
            val imagePath = result.data?.getStringExtra(RESULT_IMAGE_PATH)
            val imageFile = result.data?.getSerializableExtra(RESULT_IMAGE_FILE) as File?
            
            // Handle the image path and file
            // ...
        }
    }
}
````
